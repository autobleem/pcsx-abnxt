/*
 * The disc set of the running game and the Open button: which images belong to the game (the discs of a
 * multi-disc PBP, an .m3u next to the image, or the game folder's own images of the same kind) and the
 * change from one to the next through the core's CD lid (SetCdOpenCaseTime/LidInterrupt, as upstream's
 * menu swaps discs).
 *
 * The Open button (and the menu's "Change disc") opens the disc picker over the paused game
 * (ab_menu_change_disc, in ab_menu.c): the set's discs in a row, the one in the drive marked, the next
 * one focused, Left/Right and Cross put a disc in through the lid, Circle backs out. A single-disc game
 * gets a message instead, and so does a press in the first AB_OPEN_GRACE_S seconds of the run (Sony's
 * open_invalid_time: a game does not survive a lid opened while it boots). The screens' text is in the
 * launcher's language (ab_ui.h).
